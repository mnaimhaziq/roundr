Database:

1. Check if the mysql-connector 8.0.29 library exists in your external libraries.
2. If not, reload the project to make sure that Maven installs this library. To do this, right-click on rounder -> maven -> Reload Project.
3. Locate the file RoundrDatabase.sql which contains the SQL statements required for the project.
4. Create a new database called game.
5. Execute the SQL query contained in the RoundrDatabase.sql file to set up the necessary tables and data.
6. Once the query has been executed successfully, the project is good to go.
7. Happy Coding!
